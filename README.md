Matlab routines for crystallographic computation, including the following,


1. Constructor of transform matrix between fractional (fr.) and Cartesian (car.) coordinates

(1) TMfr2car -- transform matrix from fr. to car. coordinates

(2) TMcar2fr -- transform matrix from car. to fr. coordinates


2. Extraction of time series data

(1) ROITraceAnalyze

(2) ROIDecayAnalyze


3. Visualiz of 2D static and time series data

(1) ROIAnnotate -- 2D diffraction image with rectangular annotation of selected ROIs (regions of interest)

(2) SeriesPlot -- 2D grid plot of diffraction images (only need to select the row and column numbers)

(3) ROITracePlot -- Plot of spatially-aggregated time-series incl. normalization

(4) ROIDecayPlot -- Plot of signal decay curves for integrated ROIs
