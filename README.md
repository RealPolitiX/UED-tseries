Matlab routines for crystallographic computation, including the following,


1. Constructor of transform matrix between fractional (fr.) and Cartesian (car.) coordinates

1.1 TMfr2car -- transform matrix from fr. to car. coordinates

1.2 TMcar2fr -- transform matrix from car. to fr. coordinates


2. Extraction of time series data

2.1 ROITraceAnalyze

2.2 ROIDecayAnalyze

3. Visualiz of 2D static and time series data__
3.1 ROIAnnotate -- 2D diffraction image with rectangular annotation of selected ROIs (regions of interest)
3.2 SeriesPlot -- 2D grid plot of diffraction images (only need to select the row and column numbers)
3.3 ROITracePlot -- Plot of spatially-aggregated time-series incl. normalization__
3.4 ROIDecayPlot -- Plot of signal decay curves for integrated ROIs__
